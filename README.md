## About the project

 _The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you'll be allowed to use in all your other projects._ 

	Programming in C can be very tedious when you don't have access to the very useful standard functions.
	This project gives you the opportunity to rewrite those functions to understand them and learn to use them.
	The library will help you for your future projects in C. Through this project, you have the opportunity
	to extend your list of functions in your own way!
